# FreeTalks


A set of resources for organisers and speakers at Libre Computer Club meetings.  

Should you choose to start your own local LCC you are welcome to use the material in this repo to help with conten.  

Help yourself to the talks and use them as scripts or as inspiration for your own talks.  

It is helpful if talks that are ready for presentation can have their read/performance time appended to the tile.
