#Bit Coin is Broken
Or
###The Economics of Distributed systems in an age of abundance.


I'm going to argue that Bitcoin was abandoned, like a trojan horse, on the shores of the internets and that it is full of ideas that would be better left outside the firewalls of our technotopia?  

First off, (show of hands) who thinks crypto commodities like BitCoin, are the future of money?  
  
I almost agree, but I hope to convince you that the Bitcoin model of crypto commodity money is broken.  Not because its technically flawed, but because *scarcity is its foundational assumption.*


_(hold up bank note)_ Take a look at this Twenty Pound note.  We all know it's a token of meaning but, for now I want you to think of money purely as an abstraction layer?  This simple token hides the unbelievable complexity of modern economy and makes it understandable to our limited minds, and most importantly it scales.  Where as traditional gift economies used a human distributed consensus system which relied on reputation within a close social context, and couldn’t scale much past Dunbar's number of 150 meaningful relationships.  



So at some point in the past, when social systems grew too big for people to track who owed what to whom, as ingenious little monkeys, we invented a technology to fix the problem.  And thanks to money, when presented with almost any economic choice, all you need to ask yourself is; “Is it worth the Candle?”





Oh Just before I move on to Bitcoin, I want to ask :
Who thinks the adoption of peer production, general purpose robots and machine learning artificial intelligence is about to produce a sharp rise in productivity and material abundance?



And Who thinks that will, I could say “Disrupt” but I prefer, “totally fuck” the economic order within no time at all? 
 

And one other question.

Is there anyone here who thinks that the earth is the centre of the solar-system. The clue is in the name.  
OK, but to be fair to those that did believe the earth was the centre of gods plan,  when you see the Sun go across the sky, that's how things are!  For almost everything you want to do, it's a good enough description; but it's still wrong!  So what would it look like, if it looked like, the earth rotated round the sun? 
  
Anyway back to this 20.  -  This amazing paper A.P.I. makes it possible for everyday commerce to be uncoupled from the complex social ties that used to mediate all human interactions; and with money we can get total strangers to do our bidding, just as if they trusted us personally.  



So how did we invent cash in the first place? 
I'm sure, at one time or another, you've heard how money arose out of barter.  The short version is:
I want something you’ve got , you want something I've got, lets swap.  -
WOOT! We’ve just invented market economics.  



But wait!  



All this swapping shoos for candles is difficult, I don’t need any more shoos, so lets make it easy and just swap our stuff for something rare, I don’t know – Gold!
Yattaar!  we did it again! We've invented money.
I said it was the short version.
 
So, now we have money we can do a cost benefit analysis and work out , if “it's worth the candle?” That phrase makes almost no sense today.  But if we look back just a few generations, and compare the cost of candle light to hours worked, we find that in the eighteen hundreds you could only buy ten minutes of light for a whole hours pay.  Where as now, an hours work will keep an LED light lit for a year.



That’s just one example of the uncountable commodities that surround us today, in such abundance, that they're too cheep to meter.  So if you hope the superabundance I asked about earlier will improve society when it arrives, bare in mind that, in effect, it's already hear.  And yet we still have poverty and discontent.  Even in advanced economies, there are people who live simultaneously in objective abundance and subjective deprivation;  
And I'm completely ignoring the rest of the world. Which is what we normally do.  
But you and I are here, because we do want the world to be a better place. 



 You have a vision of what the results of re-decentralisation could be, and you think you can help build it, but so did Satoshi Nakamoto.  Which brings me to the title of this talk, 



It's not a computer science kind of broken.  So lets just pretend that we've overcome block chain bloat, diffused the hash power concentrated in mining pools and put the resources pumped into “proof of work” to good use.  Now ask yourself, having achieved all that, would adopting a perfect version of Bitcoin bring about “the more beautiful world your hearts know is possible”?  

Or will it just recreate the imbalances of power and wealth that we attempt to resist today?  
 
The real problems we face are not of technical implementation, or even of mass uptake;  The greatest threat to the social success of re-decentralisation is the conceptual assumptions we apply in its design.  
 
We want to liberate the internetworked world with free software, (unless you're just into open source. Meh!)  but how free is this software?  Our imaginations are full of metaphorical binary blobs and legacy code, and what patchy commenting does exist, is either really really hard to read, or the code it points to has since been deprecated.  Now it's obvious that our language, and with it our values and most of our ideas, came from our culture; but many of our beliefs were imposed on us by propaganda like advertising and education. 
 
And here's something you probably didn’t get taught at school. 



  For those who don't know, Anosognosia is where a person with a disease or disability, is subjectively unaware of their condition.  It's most dramatic when a blow to the head or a stroke results in paralysis. Then someone with Anosognosia, when asked if they think they could raise their paralysed arm?  Will say “Yes”.  Then, when you ask them to try, they'll fail.  So then, you ask them, “why didn't you raise your arm?” and they'll say something like, “I didn't feel like it” or (my favourite,) “No doctor that's not my arm!”.  And even when reminded of the reason for their paralysis, which they can acknowledge, the next time you ask about the arm, the loop repeats.
 
Now Anosognosia is a medical condition, and it seems bizarre to most of us, but it's an objective example of the subjective difficulties all of us can have in updating our habitual expectations and beliefs, even in the face of ample evidence.   Just think of geocenterism, the humours, epicycles, other peoples religions, and on and on.. Oh and that includes, and most importantly, the idea of money coming from barter.
 
If you think that criptographical enclosures will create digital incentives and that thus crypto commodities can be used to incentivize users to save the world and over throw the state, you are deluding yourself.   

Some of you may find that jarring, but I'm telling you, (unless you already know in which case I'm ranting for nothing,) that the evidence from anthropology and archaeology is clear (and has been for a century); money doesn't come from barter.   I mean yes barter did, and does exist, but in real life it's only used to mediate interactions between potential rivals and strangers.  The exception being, where people already habituated to money, no longer have access to it, for example cigarettes instead of money in prisons. 

The stories people tell themselves to make sense of their world, give it meaning, and so become fixed as truth.  For all our pride in human ingenuity, and eager anticipation of the coming singularity, people still fear change and are more likely to deny reality in favour of their beliefs than the reverse.   The crowning achievement of capitalism has been convincing itself that market economics is responsible for all the fantastic advances we've made in science, technology and philosophy since the renascence.  And if that were true (which it isn't!  It’s the abundance of energy and information that's responsible for modernity)  

but even if it were true that the market had filled the horn of plenty, apart from that abundance, how much better off are the majority, in terms of liberty, than the slaves - who were housed, fed and clothed by their masters, or the surfs who owed just ten days labour per month to their lords?


But whatever the dominant system, whether Feudalism, Slavery or wage labour, there has been a long history of resistance to domination but regardless of the discontent that drives idealists like us to press for change, the vast majority of people remain passive, and content with the dominant myth, incredulous to the political zeal of the few. 
Most people can see no reason to dispute Thatcher's claim that there is no alternative.  That’s Anosognosia all over, with familiar ideas demanding reality conform to expectations. 



And the myth of barter has been repeated over and over again, till it's as ingrained and natural to popular ideas of money as the earth being the centre of the cosmos was.  So I don’t really blame Setoshi (and his acolytes) for having followed their scarcity logic.  After all they've been programmed by their culture too.  
 

So Bitcoin, despite American hopes (and it's not really their fault, they've got free market libertarians) 

despite American hopes that Bitcoin will dis-empower the banksters and restore the one true money, Crypto commodities won't set the wage slaves free, not before they have elevated new masters.  And that is implicit in the idea of Bitcoin as “Gold two point o.” Just remember that the iron age kings hoarded gold one point O.  And so with Bitcoin, which emulates the masters tools, and cripto commodity currencies like it, will just recreate the same dynamics that gold had in the first place.

Deterring free riding (of a particular sort) was the reason that tyrants minted coins from gold 
in the first place.  Yes, gold does make money hard to counterfeit, and if you can't cheat, you'll have to play the game within the rules. 
 But the trick is to notice who makes the rules?  

Bitcoin's architects have tried to solve the problem of an internetworked society by porting in the iron age app called scarcity.  Surely this imposition of code as law contradicts the potential of the limitless medium.  As a free software advocate, I see Crypto commodities as D.R.M.   The logic of D.R.M. is, “If we don’t stop people from sharing everything, our stuff won't be worth anything!” And I predict that Bitcoin and Alt coins will be widely adopted, but buy people already habituated to proprietary restrictions and copyright. 
 
To sum up and reiterate; barter evolved for use between strangers and rivals and is a trust-less system and as such it offers protections which don't apply where social reputation can be tightly coupled to personal interactions.  In natural communities of people, with strong social ties, there's just no need for Barter.  People live without money to record their status all the time, just think of how you interact with the people you trust and love.  And that's the model we should be trying to emulate with re-decentralisation.  

We have the technological capability to remove the limitations that we have become used to from  money.  The necessity to simplify away all the history, personality and conviviality of human interaction and hide them behind the green curtain is antiquated.  Many in this room will no doubt want to preserve the advantages of amnesia and anonymity, but old school money has the down side of abstracting complexity to such an extent that monetary status, whether earned or stolen, can be hoarded and miss used; 



To be effective our distributed systems need means of agreeing on the social standing of other participants, money (and rank) have served that purpose in the past, but the costs of the data loss are too high.  


Our problem is not one of technical implementation or of strategy, or even of mass uptake.  The greatest threat to the social success of re-decentralisation is the conceptual habits we apply to their design.  


My aim with this talk has been to challenge you to raise your metaphorical arm?  And in implementing our new 'intrastructure' of Re-decentralisation to become aware of and recover from the delusion that markets are real rather than imagined.  

Why would we choose to keep the separation and isolation of competition and accumulation, when the internet is a means of connecting networks of people together.


The challenge is to work out how we can use distributed databases and strong consensus to enable people to reconnect into natural communities of reciprocity and collaboration, within a game designed to come to equalibrium away from todays dominating strategies of artificial scarcity. 



I’m convinced that the tools we build now, and the stories they tell, will change the world.


Thank you.
